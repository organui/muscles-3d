Changes by OrganUI: selected 428 muscle and tendon meshes and combined them into 177 structures, welded duplicate STL vertices, simplified geometry to within 0.8 mm of the source with meshoptimizer, recentered and uniformly scaled coordinates, changed axes from Z-up to Y-up, recomputed smooth normals, assigned illustrative colors, and converted STL to GLB. No sculpting or invented anatomy.
